# EntityGenerator

you can use the EntityGenerator to Generate C# classes from breeze server json metadata.
just grab the metadata from the server and save it in to a .json file anywhere you want.
then use EntityGenerator.exe to generate the files.
you can also exclude entities and namespaces from being generated by setting EntityGenerator.exe.config file appSettings.

I Hope you will enjoy using this tool which can save hours of development time
