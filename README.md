# EntityGenerator

you can use the EntityGenerator to generate C# classes from breeze server json metadata.</BR>
just grab the metadata from the server and save it into a .json file anywhere you want.</BR>
then use EntityGenerator.exe to generate the files. (if you have any problems generating the files please run as administrator)</BR>
you can also exclude entities and namespaces from being generated by setting EntityGenerator.exe.config file appSettings.</BR></BR>

I Hope you will enjoy using this tool which can save hours of development time
